# **Introduction**


TraduCode is a Chrome extension that automatically translates programming code and instructions from English to Spanish. It's designed to help Spanish-speaking developers and programming students better understand code examples encountered while browsing programming websites, tutorials, and documentation.
The extension works by identifying code blocks on web pages and translating programming keywords (such as if, for, while, etc.) into their Spanish equivalents, helping users understand programming concepts in their native language while maintaining the integrity of the code structure.

- As of right now the target programming language to translate is Python, keeping the scope small and focused allowing for faster building and testing. Choose Python as it is the most beginner friendly and widely used to target a large audience. 

## **Key Features**
- Real-time translation of programming keywords in code blocks

- Tooltip display of translated code on hover
- Toggle translation on/off with a single click
- Support for Python( for now)
- Built-in ad blocking for a cleaner browsing experience
- Works across frames and embedded content
